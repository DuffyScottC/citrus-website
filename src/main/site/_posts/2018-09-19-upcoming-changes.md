More than ten years ago I started out on a journey to implement a Java testing framework that provides automated integration tests for message-based enterprise applications with support for multiple messaging transports and data formats.
 
The result is called *[Citrus](https://github.com/citrusframework/citrus)* which is an Open Source project used by many development and testing teams all over the world. Ever since then I have spent lots of energy to further developing the Citrus framework and spreading the word for fully automated integration tests. 
It has been a very enjoyable and adventurous journey that will change somewhat in the near future. I am about to leave the company [ConSol](https://www.consol.de/) and move to distant shores along the Java Open Source community. ConSol has always been and continues to be a great sponsor and supporter of the Citrus framework.

As part of this move I will handover the lead developer role of Citrus to my colleague [@SvenHettwer](https://twitter.com/SvenHettwer). Sven is a perfect match for this position as I have spent the past twelve months working very closely with him, providing lots of insights and in-depth knowledge, on the Citrus framework. 
Project maintenance and professional consulting will be continued as before by ConSol and its test automation specialists.

As for me, I will be taking on a new opportunity (to be announced soon). Having said that I will try to continue to be part of the Citrus Open Source community. As my passion for automated integration testing is still very strong I will be thrilled to be joining forces along the path.

I am very proud of what Citrus and the community behind it have accomplished over the past decade and I am very excited to see what the future holds. I am absolutely positive that Citrus will continue to master the challenges in test automation for the software development community.
I can not wait to see that the framework continues to evolve with the goal to helping people write well tested software.
