**Happy new year everybody**

The year has just started and I'm happy that we're finally ready to share the Roadmap for Citrus in 2019 with you. 
As promised via [twitter](https://twitter.com/citrus_test/status/1073162157259440128), this year
*[...] will be about community, enhancing documentation and improving the ease of use of Citrus with a focus on the 
API, the tooling and the commonly used modules*. With more than ten years of history, Citrus has grown from a utility
framework in a customers project into a full fledged message based integration testing framework with the capability of
testing complex software systems supporting a vast amount of communication protocols and messaging technologies.
Every year, the feature set and the number of available modules has been grown and because of this, Citrus has become the
powerful, reliable and flexible testing tool it is today. And this year, we want to make Citrus even more awesome!

In this post, I'll go through all the major points of the roadmap and provide some details. But before we start, let's
have a look at some other things that we're going to change.

## Release schedule
We're planning to release a new Citrus version constantly every two months starting with the release of `v2.7.9` and
`v2.8.0` this January. This will provide a constant stream of improvements and new features to use.
In addition, we're planning to release a major version of the framework every year, to be able to improve the API based
on the feedback of the community and perform major version updates of our dependencies.

## High- and Low-Priority modules
During the lasts months, we've observed the download statistics from our maven central repository
