**Happy new year everybody**

The year has just started and I'm happy that we're finally ready to share the roadmap for Citrus in 2019 with you. 
As promised via [twitter](https://twitter.com/citrus_test/status/1073162157259440128), this year
*[...] will be about community, enhancing documentation and improving the ease of use of Citrus with a focus on the 
API, the tooling and the commonly used modules*. With more than ten years of history, Citrus has grown from a utility
framework in a customers project into a full fledged message based integration testing framework with the capability of
testing complex software systems supporting a vast amount of communication protocols and messaging technologies.
Every year, the feature set and the number of available modules has been grown and because of this, Citrus has become the
powerful, reliable and flexible testing tool it is today. And this year, we want to make Citrus even more awesome!

In this post, I'll go through all the points mentioned and provide some details. The roadmap only contains the major topics 
we want to approach. We'll still answer questions, fix bugs, add enhancements and smaller features. We'll also create
epics on GitHub for every major topic to make the progress transparent to the community. Please notice that the time
ranges marked in the timeline are more a rough estimation to give you an idea when we want to work on a certain topic.  
But before we go into the details of the roadmap, let's have a look at some other things that we're going to change.

## Release schedule
We're planning to release a new Citrus version constantly every two months starting with the release of `v2.7.9` and
`v2.8.0` this January. This will provide a constant stream of improvements and new features to you.
In addition, we're planning to release a major version of the framework once a year if required, to be able to improve
the API based on the feedback of the community and perform major version updates of our dependencies. 

## High-Priority- and Low-Priority-Modules
During the lasts months, we've monitored the download statistics from the maven central repository and recognized that
some modules are significantly more popular than others. From today on, we want to focus on the modules that are heavily
used by the community. Therefore we'll divide the Citurs modules into *High-Priority-Modules* and *Low-Priority-Modules*.
Newer Modules are also High-Priority as they just have to establish first. We'll invest the major part of our time into the 
High-Priority-Modules to improve the documentation, samples and GitHub support and also focus on bug fixes and new features.
The Low-Priority-Modules on the other hand, will take a back seat concerning this topics. If you're interested to help
us maintaining one of the modules, feel free to contact us and propose pull requests. We always appreciate any kind of
contribution.
